# ``BbAppAuthProviderSchema``

Protocol definitions and data structures for authentication providers.

## Overview

The BbAppAuthProviderSchema library defines the core protocols and data structures that all authentication providers must implement. It includes the ``BbAppAuthProviderProtocol`` that defines the contract for authentication providers, ``BbAppAuthProviderState`` for managing provider state, and supporting structures for callbacks, options, and placement. This schema enables a pluggable authentication system where different authentication methods can be seamlessly integrated.
